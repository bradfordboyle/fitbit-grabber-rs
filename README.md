1. client ID
2. client secret

To obtain a client ID and secret, [register an application][].

1. For "OAuth 2.0 Application Type", select "Personal". The reason for this
   requirement is that intraday series data is only available for persoanl
   applications.
2. For "Callback URL", enter "http://localhost:8080".

After completing the registration, you will need to export the client id and
secret as environmner variables:

```sh
export FITBIT_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
export FITBIT_CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret>
```

### Requesting an OAuth 2.0 Token

You will need to first generate and store a token for subsequent API calls

```sh
./fitbit-grabber token
```

If the above command is successful, the OAuth 2.0 token will be stored in a file
called ".token" in the working directory.
